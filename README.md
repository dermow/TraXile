## Features
* Live tracking of your map runs and other activities
* Calculation of statistics
* Bossing Info

## How it works
All we need is the path to your game logfile (Client.txt). TraXile will read the whole file the first time. After that it is live
tracking your logfile for updates.

## How to install
Just download the latest release from the GitHub releases page, extract it and start with "TraXile.exe"

## How to update
I am working on an auto update function, but till this is implemented, just download the latest zip and replace the files in your install directory with 
the newer ones :) Make sure too keep "stats.cache", "TraXile.exe.config" and "data.db" as these files are holding your data!

## Virus Warnings
As I am not using a Code signing certificate, some virus scanners (e.g. Windows defender) will trigger an alert. You can start it anyway. This is not a virus :-)
